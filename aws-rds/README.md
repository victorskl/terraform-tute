# aws-rds

Remember:
- In conventional setup, we can run a RDBMS in a **standalone** or **cluster**  mode.
- In terraform for AWS _managed_ RDBMS services, this concept basically apply into `aws_db_instance` and `aws_rds_cluster` resources respectively. And `aws_rds_cluster` is a synonym to Amazon Aurora.

Engine:
- Engine Type API: [CreateDBInstance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/APIReference/API_CreateDBInstance.html):
    - aurora (for MySQL 5.6-compatible Aurora)
    - aurora-mysql (for MySQL 5.7-compatible Aurora)
    - aurora-postgresql
    - mariadb
    - mysql
    - oracle-ee
    - oracle-se2
    - oracle-se1
    - oracle-se
    - postgres
    - sqlserver-ee
    - sqlserver-se
    - sqlserver-ex
- These goes to terraform `aws_db_instance` resource [engine](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/db_instance.html#engine) flag and `aws_rds_cluster` resource [engine](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/rds_cluster.html#engine) flag. Note that `aws_rds_cluster` resource engine flag only accept `aurora`, `aurora-mysql`, `aurora-postgresql`. (Recall: therefore a synonym to Aurora service only). If you are creating any _aurora-ish_ engine type, you are as well be creating a `aws_rds_cluster`.

DBInstanceClass:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Concepts.DBInstanceClass.html
- Note that Aurora only support `r3`, `r4`, `r5` and `t2`, `t3` classes.

### aws_db_instance

There are 3 possibilities:

1. Write up RDS resource creation using [`aws_db_instance`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/db_instance.html) and, for related resources.
2. Then; you find that you could arrange this ad-hoc code as [terraform module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/index.html), therefore, create and maintain your own RDS terraform module.
3. However; you realize that there are other do like you do and, found many (well maintain and coded) RDS modules in terraform module registry; and over github.

Verdict: Do [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) unless necessary, so just use:
- https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds/aws/1.28.0
- https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-rds


### aws_rds_cluster 
(aka aurora)

Similarly for Aurora; you could write from scratch using [`aws_rds_cluster`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/rds_cluster.html) and related resources. But just simply use the following module.

- https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/rds-aurora/aws/1.12.0
- https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-rds-aurora

### serverless

When you are creating RDBMS cluster either by: 
1. creating a bunch of `aws_db_instance` resources and network them up together yourself 
2. or using managed Aurora service through creating `aws_rds_cluster` resource

You will end up a few db instances up and running in a cluster. Depends on stochastic user load, there might be a need for scaling up or down of these db instances. You might also want to autonomously mange on these scaling events. This is something to reckon with [AWS Auto Scaling](https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/). 

However, if you can limit yourself with Aurora service, it provides this feature with [engine mode `serverless`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/rds_cluster.html#engine_mode).
